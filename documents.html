            <h2>Helpful Tip</h2>
            <p>
                Keep all documents in a re-sealable folder in your carry-on or hand luggage for easy travel access. 
                It is wise to scan these documents and save electronic copies, email them to yourself, or leave another set 
                of documents with your family in case you lose the originals.
